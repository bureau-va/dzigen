# dzigen
A command line tool to generate DZI images

# Installation
dzigen uses [deepzoomtools](https://github.com/zoomhub/node-deepzoomtools) so
you'll need ImageMagick installed for this to work.
If you're on OSX, run ```brew install imagemagick``` to install it.

Install dzigen with ```npm install -g dzigen```
The global flag is optional, but you'd most likely want to have it available as
a global command.
